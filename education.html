<font color="white">Secondary school on 2011 at Sekolah Menengah Raja Perempuan Ipoh (Raja Perempuan School) at Perak from Form 1 until Form 4<br>
This school is 100% only for girls which it will be weird to see even a boy here<br>
For Form 1 and Form 2, I experienced to go school at the evening which the school start on 1pm until 6pm. This is because they already have Form 1 and Form 2 in the morning as they were hostel's student<br>
When I were Form 3, the school start at the morning session and it have 9 classes which are Avicennia, Azalea, Begonia, Bougainvillea, Camellia, Dahlia, Dahlia, Eugenia and Jasmine<br>
The hostel's student and daily students will be put under same class<br>
My class have 42 students if we were not being separated which we are the class that have many students<br>
On Form 4, I am the part of Account student<br>
At this school I take Peperiksaan Menengah Rendah (PMR)<br>

<font color="white">On 2015, we moved to Kedah and we made a new journey as we never experience things outside from Ipoh other than holiday<br>
So, I went to Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Tanjung Pauh, Jitra, Kedah and there are school for girls and boys just like other schools<br>
At this school I took Sport Science subject as they does not provide Economic Principles subject. I got chance to learn new subject which I never heard about this subject before<br>
I took Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) here and created more memories with new friends even we just sat in same class for a year<br>
