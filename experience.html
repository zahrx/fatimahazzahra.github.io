Joined silat when I am Form 1 at SMK Raja Perempuan Ipoh. I never involved myself in activities like this in primary school but interested with silat when I am in secondary school<br>
I was president silat for 3 years and 1 year as secretary<br>
There were 3 categories which are single known as "Solo", partner known as "Tempur" and group known as "Masal". I took part in "Tempur" or partner category<br>
We went for competition for state area. We will practice at the school or at Sekolah Agama Izzuddin Shah for the competition<br>
My friend and I won 2 times at 2011 and 2013 for the second places<br>
Not only for competition, we also do performance at school for some event which it was fun and created memories at school<br>

As for the last sem, I involved with 'tarik tali' competition as for sports between faculty<br>
We, team B managed to get the third place and team A managed to get first place<br>
It was fun and challenging as we need to compete with another faculty and I get to know other student from different semester and faculty<br>

<br>
At the first semester in UiTM Kedah, my friends and I involved with archery club and we went to hiking at Gunung Jerai<br>
We spent 2 days and 1 night at there. We hiking together, set up the tent, cooked together and do many activites together such as night walk and swam at 4am<br>
It was memoreable because no many of us had went to Gunung Jerai and to go there for the first time, we surely will come back<br>

Went to Thailand on 2015 and it was my first experience to go somewhere out from Malaysia. I was nervous and excited at the same time<br>
To see a new places, a new culture and tasted new foods made me want to go overseas more than once<br>
My family and I went there with another few people which they are my mother's friends. It was a trip to Thailand<br>
We waited for hours to pass the boarding pass because there were so many people such as tourist want to go to Thailand<br>
To hear another languange than malaysia's languange was awkward for the first time but it get better actually<br>
It was fun to get up at a new place and new journey waiting<br>
We went to the beach, some market to buy things and took a lot of pictures<br>
I am surely miss the orginal 'Tom Yum' from there<br>

My second trip was to Indonesia, our country siblings<br>
If the trip before we need to que to hours but this trip, we went to KLIA2 in the early morning so we could catch our flight but it was still fun to go somewhere out from our country so we could gain more knowledge<br>
We took pictures and bought few things. 'Nasi Ayam Penyet' is the best there but from there, I gained new experience which I learnt to never say your life is so bad because there are so many people out there are having much difficulties than us<br>
At the Indonesia, there were so many people have the opportunity to live a good life. It was such an open eyes for me. Kids and parents were finding money by selling things or singing<br>

For the third trip, we went to Singapore and this time my older sister, her husband and daughter followed us as before they had no chance to join because they were busy with work<br>
A day before we go to Singapore, we went to Johor as we slept there<br>
In the early morning, we catch our ride to Singapore with bus as they are a punctual country and they move pretty fast<br>
We went Singapore Universal Studio and it was really fun as we already wanted to come years ago<br>
We had fun and shared laugh together. We gained many new experinces<br>
I rode rollercoaster name Battlestar Galactica twice which one represented the Humans and one represented the Cylons. The rollercoaster is the tallest dueling coasters in the world<br>
Met Puss in the Boot, Shrek and even Marilyn Monroe!<br>
